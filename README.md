# CollectionofCheminformaticProject
Collection of some cheminformatic project I have done in the University Classroom

This Github repository contains some coding and project 
I have committed to in the classroom related to machine learning, computational chemistry, and data science at my University.

Project 1: Organic's compound solubility prediction using Molecular descriptors 

Project 2: Deep learning's approach for solubility prediction 

Project3: Implement PCA from the Scratch

Project4(Not complete): Trying generate new molecule using Self-Referencing Embedded Strings (SELFIES) and RNN(Recurrent Neural Network)
